# Audio Tag Editor

Edit mp3 and flac tags using Python 3 Windows GUI with the help of Poe A.I. (www.poe.com).

## Install

0. Create a venv `python -m venv path/to/venv` and 
1. source it `path/to/venv/Scripts/activate` eg. (`X:\Python\.venv\audio-tag-editor\Scripts\activate` or `..\.venv\audio-tag-editor\Scripts\activate` if in parent dir of the project)
2. Go to project root and install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start the program with `python app.py`

Deactivate venv by typing `deactivate`

## Usage (at least how this should work!)

This will be generated by the A.I. for most part, so let's see :D

1. Run the program
2. Drag'n'drop audio files to the GUI
3. Edit the files

## Goals

Kind of like an extended music player

- [x] Be able to drag'n'drop mp3 files to the program
- [ ] Show the dropped files in a scrollable table
- [ ] The table should have default columns for some of the ID3v2 tags (artist, title, genre)
- [ ] Be able to go up/down the table using arrow keys
- [ ] Be able to play the active mp3 by pressing Enter (or by double-clicking)
- [ ] Be able to go to previous/next file with UI buttons
- [ ] User should be able to click on a tag on a row to show an editable text field and save the updated text when pressing Enter or clicking away from the editor
- [ ] User should be able to add a new "checkbox" style custom key/value tag to the file where the value is simply "X"
- [ ] User should be able to check/uncheck the custom tag by clicking on it
